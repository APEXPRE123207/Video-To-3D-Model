## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### 1. Anaconda (Recommended)
- Download and setup Anaconda.
- Create a new virtual environment with
  ```bash
  conda create -n your_env_name python==3.8
    ```
- Now download the required python libraries from the requirement.txt.
  ```bash
  conda install --file requirementsconda.txt
  pip install -r requirementspip.txt
  ```

### 2. CUDA Installation

- Launch the CUDA installer and choose **Custom Installation**.
- Select only:
    - CUDA Toolkit
    - CUDA Compiler
    - CUDA Visual Studio Integration
    - Development
- After installation, verify with:

```bash
nvcc --version
```

---

### 3. Visual Studio Setup

Install **Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition** with the following components:

- Desktop development with C++
- MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools
- C++ CMake tools for Windows
- Windows SDK (choose based on your OS):
    - Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22000.0)
    - Windows 10 SDK (10.0.x)

---

### 4. Instant-NGP Installation \& Build

Clone and build Instant-NGP:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp
cd instant-ngp
```

**Using CMake GUI:**

- Source: `C:/path/to/instant-ngp`
- Build: `C:/path/to/instant-ngp/build`
- Click **Configure** â†’ Choose *Visual Studio 17 2022* â†’ Finish
- Click **Generate** â†’ Open Project

**In Visual Studio:**

- Set to **Release Mode**
- Go to *Build > Build Solution*

**Alternative Command Line Build:**

```bash
cd C:\path\to\instant-ngp\build
cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo
```

## Convert Video to 3D Model  
### 1. Run `video_to_COLMAP.py`

- You will be asked for the path to the source video file.
-You will be given the current fps of the video the total number of frames, and be asked for the preferred frame sample rate per second - for example: 2 fps. (Recommended - 1 frame/second)
- Type `y` to view the COLMAP graph (optional).
- The generated `transforms.json` will be saved in your current working root directory (i.e. if current working directory is W:\Project\.. it will get stored in W:).

---

### 2. Prepare Instant-NGP Scene

- Copy `transforms.json` into:

```
instant-ngp/build/instant-ngp/data/v2obj/ (Only if you built instant-ngp inside the original folder )
```

- Ensure the following files are inside the `v2obj` folder:
    - Frame images (from video)
    - `transforms.json`
    - `correction1.py`
    - `correction2.py`
- Run the correction scripts:

```bash
python correction1.py
python correction2.py
```


---

### 3. Launch Instant-NGP Viewer

From Anaconda Prompt, run:

```bash
.\instant-ngp.exe --scene "path\to\instant-ngp\data\v2obj"
```


---

| File Name | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- |
| `video_to_frames.py` | Extracts frames from video as images |
| `video_to_COLMAP.py` | Orchestrates the full pipeline: extraction, COLMAP, and visualization |
| `visualize_COLMAP_output.py` | Visualizes camera positions/orientations from COLMAP output |
| `correction1.py` | Fixes image paths in `transforms.json` for Instant-NGP compatibility |
| `correction2.py` | Verifies that image files are valid and not corrupted |

## ðŸ§© Troubleshooting / FAQ

**CMake cannot find CUDA**

- Go to *System Properties > Environment Variables*
- Under *System Variables*, click **New**:
    - Variable name: `CUDAToolkit_ROOT`
    - Variable value: `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.4`
- Restart your terminal or Visual Studio.

**CMake Error at fmt/CMakeLists.txt:234**

If you see:

```
target_compile_features no known features for CXX compiler "MSVC"
```

Run:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Ensure the following structure exists:

```
instant-ngp/
â””â”€â”€ dependencies/
    â””â”€â”€ tiny-cuda-nn/
        â””â”€â”€ dependencies/
            â””â”€â”€ fmt/
                â””â”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
```

## ðŸ§  Notes

- This pipeline is optimized for GPU-based rendering.
- Ensure you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support.
- Use `RelWithDebInfo` for faster runtime and debugging support.
- Feel free to suggest improvements or raise issues via GitHub.

**Happy 3D modeling! ðŸ§ŠðŸ“¹ðŸ§ **
